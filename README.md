BandMaxSAT: A Local Search MaxSAT Solver with Multi-armed Bandit
----
This repository contains the code to the BandMaxSAT algorithm for the MaxSAT proposed in our paper: <br> <br>
[BandMaxSAT: A Local Search MaxSAT Solver with Multi-armed Bandit (IJCAI 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05544) <br>
Jiongzhi Zheng, Kun He, Jianrong Zhou, Yan Jin, Chu-Min Li, Felip Manya <br> <br>

Installation
----
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: <br> <br>

unzip BandMaxSAT-main.zip <br>
cd BandMaxSAT-main <br>
make <br> <br>

An executable file called BandMaxSAT will now be available in the directory BandMaxSAT-main. <br>
Then enter the command ./BandMaxSAT instance_name, to run the algorithm. <br> <br>
